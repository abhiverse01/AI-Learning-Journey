# AI-Learning-Journey

![Repo-Wallpaper](artificialintelligence.png)

Welcome to the AI-Learning-Journey repository! This repository contains various Colab notebooks and Python files that served as my learning resources while delving into the core concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Contents

1. **Introduction Notebook**: A beginner-friendly introduction to AI, providing an overview of its history, applications, and future potential.
2. **Core Terminology in Python**: A comprehensive notebook covering essential definitions and core terminology used in Python, specifically tailored for AI applications.
3. **AI Implementations and Algorithmic Explanations**: A series of notebooks and Python files detailing various AI algorithms, their implementations, and explanations. These include but are not limited to:
   - Supervised Learning
   - Unsupervised Learning
   - Reinforcement Learning
   - Neural Networks
   - Deep Learning

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhiverse01/AI-Learning-Journey.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd AI-Learning-Journey
    ```
3. **Open the Notebooks**:
    - You can open the Jupyter notebooks locally using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
    - Alternatively, you can open them in Google Colab by uploading the notebook files.

## Getting Started

For those new to AI or looking to refresh their knowledge, start with the `Definitions Notebook`. It provides a solid foundation and context for the subsequent, more advanced notebooks. As you progress, each notebook builds on the previous one, gradually introducing more complex concepts and algorithms.
